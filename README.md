# DEXPredictionBot (Malogna version)

This bot fetches the overall consensus of the 5min and 1min BNB/USDT charts based on a number of TA signals provided by Trading View. It determines if the consensus is a BUY or SELL prior to each prediction round and places the bet on PancakeSwap or CandleGenie accordingly.

## What is this fork?
The original code for this created by jontstaz had an automatic "donation" function before every tx. It never worked as intended and most of the times just took half of your BNB. This fork:
- Removes the donation function
- Makes the wait for the bet closer to the close, creating a more accurate bet. (Change this in /src/index.ts if you experience failed TXs)


## NFA and DYOR!

Credits to Modagavr for original build. I extended the bot greatly to make it much smarter as opposed to just following/going against the trend of other bettors.
